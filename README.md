### Restaurant Reviews App (Stage 1)  

#### Description
Project created as part of the Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree.

#### Project Instructions  
In this project, a static webpage that lacks accessibility is given to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The design must be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. It will also be added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for the users.

#### Run the Application
Download as .zip file or clone this project:

  ``$ git clone : https://github.com/ywzheng1/Restaurant-Reviews-App-Stage1.git``

In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

With your server running, visit the site: http://localhost:8000.
